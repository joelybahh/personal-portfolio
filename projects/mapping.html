              <p class="mb-4">
                In collaboration with my colleague,
                <strong
                  ><a
                    class="text-blue-500 hover:underline dark:text-blue-500"

                  ></strong
                >, who led the initial development, I had the opportunity to
                contribute significantly to the evolution of an innovative
                web-based <strong>interactive mapping platform</strong>.
                Originally designed to enhance the presentation of commercial
                real estate portfolios, ETFs, and REITs, our combined efforts
                have transformed it into a versatile tool that caters to a wide
                array of users, from real estate professionals to landlords and
                agents. My involvement became particularly instrumental during
                the platform's recent rewrite, which introduced a robust
                <strong>abstraction layer</strong> to its architecture,
                elevating the user experience and system flexibility.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                This phase of the project was about enhancing and expanding the
                platform's capabilities, focusing on the middle layer UI where I
                played a key role in refining the
                <strong>JSON schema</strong> that underpins our user interface.
                The introduction of this schema-driven approach not only
                streamlined the customization process but also made the platform
                more adaptable, allowing users to interact with their data in
                more meaningful ways. By working closely with
                <strong>Ben</strong> and leveraging our shared vision, we've
                been able to push the boundaries of what interactive mapping
                platforms can achieve, making complex data more accessible and
                actionable for our users.

                <h3 class="mb-6">Schema Design</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  At the heart of our interactive mapping platform lies a
                  meticulously crafted <strong>JSON schema</strong>, a blueprint
                  that defines the structure and interactivity of our user
                  interface. This schema is more than just a static
                  configuration; it is <strong>contextually aware</strong>,
                  adapting the UI to reflect the different types of information
                  users might need based on their current interaction mode.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  One of the schema's core concepts is the
                  <code>contextual</code> property. This property serves as a
                  decision-maker that tailors the user experience according to
                  specific contexts. For example, when the URL parameter
                  <code>?mode=insights</code> is detected, the schema consults
                  the <code>contextual</code>
                  property to determine which UI elements to display. This
                  enables a dynamic shift in the layout and information
                  presented, creating a custom-tailored experience without the
                  need for separate pages or manual intervention.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  Under the <code>contextual</code> branch, we delve into
                  <code>insights</code>, a mode-driven feature that rearranges
                  the platform's interface to highlight different data points
                  and visualization cards pertinent to the user's current focus.
                  Whether it's an in-depth look at a single asset, a comparative
                  view in a multi-asset scenario, or a detailed examination of a
                  specific space, the schema intelligently adjusts the UI
                  elements.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  For instance, the <strong>asset</strong>,
                  <strong>multi</strong>, and <strong>space</strong> keys within
                  the <code>contextual</code> object point to different data
                  types and card layouts designed to emphasize particular
                  aspects of the assets or spaces in question. This allows for a
                  seamless transition between viewing modes, such as switching
                  from a macro-level overview to a granular analysis of
                  individual properties, all governed by the schema's versatile
                  structure.
                </p>
                <pre><code id="code-contextual-sample" class="language-javascript"></code></pre>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  This schema-centric approach not only streamlines the UI
                  customization process but also significantly enhances the
                  platform's adaptability, ensuring that users always have the
                  most relevant and insightful data at their fingertips.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  The above is just a small sample of what's under the hood,
                  those <code>accordions</code> strings, point to another data
                  structure that contains a <code>name</code>, and
                  <code>items</code>. Items is a simple array of strings,
                  mapping to <code>cards</code>. Cards are a bit like UI modules
                  or building blocks, they are the smallest unit of UI that can
                  be rendered.

                      The <code>cards</code> array is a collection of UI
                      components that can be rendered. Each card has a
                      <code>type</code> and <code>items</code> array. The
                      <code>type</code> is a string that maps to a UI component,
                      and the <code>items</code> array is a collection of data
                      pointers that are passed to the UI component.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  The <strong>abstraction layer</strong> I introduced to the
                  platform's UI components has been instrumental in enhancing
                  the user experience and system flexibility. By creating a
                  <strong>context-aware</strong> UI component that can adapt to
                  different data types and interaction modes. This base
                  abstraction layer has allowed us to build a more
                  <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> UI.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  Below is a simplified example of how the abstraction layer
                  works. The <code>SwitchRenderer</code> component takes a
                  <code>value</code> prop and renders the appropriate UI
                  component based on the value. This allows us to create a
                  single component that can render different UI components based
                  on the data it receives.

                <h3 class="mb-6 mt-8">API / Database Design</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  The API was built on <strong>Azure Functions</strong> and the
                  database was built on <strong>Postgres SQL</strong>, with the
                  schema defined by <strong>typeORM</strong>. The database
                  design had to be built around abstractions due to the dynamic
                  nature of the platform. This added complexity to the database
                  design, but was essential for the flexibility of the platform.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  The initial API was built for a quick to market, easy to use
                  approach, but as the platform grew, we needed to refactor the
                  API to be more <strong>modular</strong> and
                  <strong>scalable</strong>. This allowed us to build a
                  <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>intuitive</strong> API
                  that can be easily extended and adapted to meet the needs of
                  our users.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  The refactoed API, however, was designed to allow for
                  <strong>micro requests</strong> and
                  <strong>complex select and filter queries</strong>, enabling
                  users to interact with their data in more meaningful ways.
                  This required a careful balance between
                  <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong>,
                  but the end result was a powerful and
                  <strong>intuitive</strong> API.
