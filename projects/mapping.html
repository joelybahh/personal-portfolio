          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In collaboration with my colleague, <strong><a class="dark:text-blue-500 text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                href="https://github.com/zottiben">Ben Zotti</a></strong>, who led the initial
            development, I had the opportunity to
            contribute significantly to the evolution of an innovative web-based <strong>interactive mapping
              platform</strong>.
            Originally designed to enhance the presentation of commercial real estate portfolios, ETFs, and REITs, our
            combined efforts have transformed it into a versatile tool that caters to a wide array of users, from real
            estate professionals to landlords and agents. My involvement became particularly instrumental during the
            platform's recent rewrite, which introduced a robust <strong>abstraction layer</strong> to its architecture,
            elevating the
            user experience and system flexibility.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            This phase of the project was about enhancing and expanding the platform's capabilities, focusing on the
            middle layer UI where I played a key role in refining the <strong>JSON schema</strong> that underpins our
            user interface. The
            introduction of this schema-driven approach not only streamlined the customization process but also made the
            platform more adaptable, allowing users to interact with their data in more meaningful ways. By working
            closely with <strong>Ben</strong> and leveraging our shared vision, we've been able to push the boundaries
            of what
            interactive mapping platforms can achieve, making complex data more accessible and actionable for our users.
          </p>

          <h1 class="mt-8">What I Worked On</h1>
          <h2 class="mb-6">Schema Design</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            At the heart of our interactive mapping platform lies a meticulously crafted <strong>JSON schema</strong>, a
            blueprint that defines the structure and interactivity of our user interface. This schema is more than just
            a static configuration; it is <strong>contextually aware</strong>, adapting the UI to reflect the different
            types of information users might need based on their current interaction mode.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            One of the schema's core concepts is the <code>contextual</code> property. This property serves as a
            decision-maker that tailors the user experience according to specific contexts. For example, when the URL
            parameter <code>?mode=insights</code> is detected, the schema consults the <code>contextual</code> property
            to determine which UI elements to display. This enables a dynamic shift in the layout and information
            presented, creating a custom-tailored experience without the need for separate pages or manual intervention.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Under the <code>contextual</code> branch, we delve into <code>insights</code>, a mode-driven feature that
            rearranges the platform's interface to highlight different data points and visualization cards pertinent to
            the user's current focus. Whether it's an in-depth look at a single asset, a comparative view in a
            multi-asset scenario, or a detailed examination of a specific space, the schema intelligently adjusts the UI
            elements.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            For instance, the <strong>asset</strong>, <strong>multi</strong>, and <strong>space</strong> keys within the
            <code>contextual</code> object point to different data types and card layouts designed to emphasize
            particular aspects of the assets or spaces in question. This allows for a seamless transition between
            viewing modes, such as switching from a macro-level overview to a granular analysis of individual
            properties, all governed by the schema's versatile structure.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  "contextual": {
    "insights": {
      "asset": {
        "accordions": [
          "building_details", 
          "building_overview", 
          "building_availability"
        ], 
      },
      "multi": {
        "accordions": [
          "precinct_overview", 
          "precinct_buildings"
        ]
      },
      "space": {
        "accordions": [
          "listing_overview", 
          "listing_details"
        ],
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This schema-centric approach not only streamlines the UI customization process but also significantly
            enhances the platform's adaptability, ensuring that users always have the most relevant and insightful data
            at their fingertips.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The above is just a small sample of what's under the hood, those <code>accordions</code> strings, point to
            another data structure that contains a <code>name</code>, and <code>items</code>.
            Items is a simple array of strings, mapping to <code>cards</code>. Cards are a bit like UI modules or
            building blocks, they are the smallest unit of UI that can be rendered.

  },
}</code></pre>
              <p class="mb-4">
                The <code>cards</code> array is a collection of UI components that can be rendered. Each card has a
                <code>type</code> and <code>items</code> array. The <code>type</code> is a string that maps to a UI
                component, and the <code>items</code> array is a collection of data pointers that are passed to the UI
                component.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="language-javascript">{

          <h2 class="mb-6 mt-8">UI Component Abstraction</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The <strong>abstraction layer</strong> I introduced to the platform's UI components has been instrumental
            in
            enhancing the user experience and system flexibility. By creating a <strong>context-aware</strong> UI
            component
            that can adapt to different data types and interaction modes. This base abstraction layer has allowed us
            to build a more <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> UI.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Below is a simplified example of how the abstraction layer works. The <code>SwitchRenderer</code> component
            takes a <code>value</code> prop and renders the appropriate UI component based on the value. This allows us
            to create a single component that can render different UI components based on the data it receives.
          </p>

          <pre class="line-numbers tab-size[4]"><code class="language-javascript">const ContextualCard = ({ card }) => {  
  return (
    &lt;SwitchRenderer value={card.type}&gt;
      &lt;Case value={CardTypes.Grid}&gt;
         &lt;Grid items={card.items}/&gt;
      &lt;/Case&gt;
      &lt;Case value={CardTypes.List}&gt;
          &lt;List items={card.items}/&gt;
      &lt;/Case&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/SwitchRenderer&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

            - The database was built on Postgres SQL, schema defined by typeORM
            - The database design had to be built around abstractions due to the dynamic nature of the platform
            - This added complexity to the database design, but was essential for the flexibility of the platform

          -->
          <p class="mb-4">
            The API was built on <strong>Azure Functions</strong> and the database was built on <strong>Postgres
              SQL</strong>,
            with the schema defined by <strong>typeORM</strong>. The database design had to be built around abstractions
            due to the dynamic nature of the platform. This added complexity to the database design, but was essential
            for the flexibility of the platform.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The initial API was built for a quick to market, easy to use approach, but as the platform grew, we needed
            to refactor the API to be more <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong>. This allowed us to
            build a <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>intuitive</strong> API that can be easily extended and adapted
            to meet the needs of our users.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The refactoed API, however, was designed to allow for <strong>micro requests</strong> and <strong>complex
              select and filter
              queries</strong>, enabling users to interact with their data in more meaningful ways. This required a
            careful balance between <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong>, but the end result
            was a powerful and <strong>intuitive</strong> API.
